Stock Price Prediction 
Overview
This Python script uses historical stock price data to build and evaluate predictive models for future stock prices, specifically using Linear and Ridge Regression. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library and covers the stock price of a specified company (Apple, Inc. by default) over a specified date range. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:

pandas for data manipulation
yfinance for downloading historical stock data
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for machine learning model training and evaluation
statsmodels for statistical tests and validation
